-- a) For the given value 210:
[x | x<-[1..210], 210 `mod` x==0]

-- For any given value to n: 
-- (i.e. n = assigned integer by user, and then the code below)
[x | x<-[1..n], n `mod` x==0]

-- b) For a, b as sides and c as hypotenuse of the triangle:
-- (we set one side bigger than the other, a<b, to avoid swaps)
[(a, b, c) | a<-[1..100], b<-[1..100], c<-[1..100], a<b, a^2+b^2==c^2]
